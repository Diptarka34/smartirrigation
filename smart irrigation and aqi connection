Understood 👍
Here is **ONLY THE WIRING** — no code, no explanation.

---

## 🔌 POWER

* **Arduino 5V → Breadboard + rail**
* **Arduino GND → Breadboard – rail**

---

## 🌫️ MQ-2 GAS SENSOR

* **VCC → + rail (5V)**
* **GND → – rail (GND)**
* **AO → Arduino A0**
* **DO → Not connected**

## 🌫️ GAS INDICATOR LEDs

### 🟢 Green LED (SAFE air)

* **Arduino D8 → 220Ω resistor → LED long leg**
* **LED short leg → GND rail**

### 🔴 Red LED (BAD air)

* **Arduino D9 → 220Ω resistor → LED long leg**
* **LED short leg → GND rail**

---

## ⏱️ TIMER LEDs

### 🔴 Red Timer LED (8 sec)

* **Arduino D6 → 220Ω resistor → LED long leg**
* **LED short leg → GND rail**

### 🟢 Green Timer LED (rest time)

* **Arduino D7 → 220Ω resistor → LED long leg**
* **LED short leg → GND rail**
